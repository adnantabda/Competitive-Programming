# Easy

This folder contains a collection of easy-level competitive programming questions that I solved.

## Folder Structure

The "Easy" folder is organized as follows:

```
├── Easy
│   ├── Question1.py
│   ├── Question2.py
│   └── ...
```

Each question is represented by a separate file, named in a descriptive manner such as `Question1.py` or `Question2.py`.

## Getting Started

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Browse through the files in the "Easy" folder and choose a question you would like to solve.
2. Open the corresponding file in your preferred programming language.
3. Read the problem statement and any additional instructions provided within the file.
4. Implement your solution to the problem in the given file.
5. Test your solution by running the code and verifying its correctness.
6. Repeat the process for other questions in the "Easy" folder.

Feel free to modify the code files as needed and use any additional resources or libraries that are allowed according to the problem statement.

## Contributing

If you have your own solutions to the questions in the "Easy" folder or have identified any issues, improvements, or new questions, I welcome your contributions. Please follow the standard guidelines for contributing to open-source projects, including creating pull requests and providing clear and concise descriptions of your changes.
