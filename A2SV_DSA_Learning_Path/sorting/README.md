# Sorting

- sorting is the process of placing elements from a collection in some kind of order. there are number of algorithms benefit from having a sorted list like binary search.

- the efficiency of sorting algorithm is related to the number of items being processed. 

- for a small collection, a complex sorting method may be more trouble than it worth. 

operations that are used to analyze sorting algorithm
1) compare two values to see which one is smaller, larger , comes first or last (compare values)

2) when values are not in their correct position exchange them (total number of exchanges will be important for evaluating the overall efficiency of the algorithm)

## Some common types of sorting Algorithms 

- Insertion sort
- counting sort
- cyclic sort 
- bubble sort 
- selection sort
- shell sort 
- merge sort 
- quick sort
