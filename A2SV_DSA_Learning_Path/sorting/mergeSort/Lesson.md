# Merge Sort

it uses divide and conquer strategy as a way to improve the performance of sorting algorithms. it is also a recursive algorithm that continually splits a list in half. if the list is empty or has one item, it is sorted by definition(the base case). if the list has more than one element we split the list and recursively invoke the merge sort on both halves. 

merging is a process of taking two smaller sorted list and combining them together into a single, sorted new list.
